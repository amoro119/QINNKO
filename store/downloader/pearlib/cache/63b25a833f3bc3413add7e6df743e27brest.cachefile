With great new features!";s:1:"d";s:953:"The very popular ModuleCreator is now available via Magento Connect. It seamlessly integrates into your Magento installation and is available unter http://your.magento/moduleCreator/. Its interface is protected by your Magento Admin credentials.

Also make sure you read the book <a href="http://www.jhuskisson.com/magento-1-3-php-developers-guide">"Magento 1.3: PHP Developers Guide"</a> by Jamie Huskisson about more insides about Magento Programming.

It is now even more flexible: Use and distribute your own module skeletons (blank modules). The new ModuleCreator is capable of scanning its local skeleton template dir to auto-detect custom module skeletons. You can select from the dropdown menu which skeleton to use.

Writing your own skeleton is very easy: Simplify your process of module creation.

Be part of the open source community: distribute your skeletons via Magento Connect and help other developers to speed up their developing time.";s:1:"r";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:47:"/Chiara_PEAR_Server_REST/r/Netz98_ModuleCreator";}}}
